'''Task 2.1:
2.1 LetÂ´s start with simple baseline (at your own choice).
For example, build a logistic regression model based on pre-trained word embeddings or TF-IDF vectors
of the financial news corpus **
i.e.Build a baseline model with Financial Phrasebank dataset.
What are the limitations of these baseline models?
